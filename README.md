# Welcome!
FUDGE is a lightweight open-source game engine and editor created for educating students in an academic environment in the field of design and development of games and highly interactive applications. It may also be used as a rapid prototyping tool to easly convey and evaluate ideas for applications and games and as a tool to create educational games.

# Wiki
To get started with FUDGE, please browse through the [Wiki](https://github.com/JirkaDellOro/FUDGE/wiki) to learn about the core concepts and the inner workings of FUDGE. Doing so, will grant you an intuitive understanding extremely helpful for further working with FUDGE.

# Modules
## Core
Contains the core functionality of FUDGE needed to create games. For many games it's sufficient to work only with this module.
# UserInterface
Comtains the classes for easy and even automatic creation of graphical interfaces using the mutator concept (see Wiki). This module is heavily used in the editor and can be used and extended for games.
# Network
Contains components for gaming over networks. This module is not fully evaluated yet.
# Aid
Contains collections of classes for convenience, bundling and simplifying commonn procedures.
